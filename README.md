## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It is not required but I abled to a the email to an array.

- I learned that it is best practice to test right after the completion of an expected working component. This way you have shorter amount of code to debug.

- Misspelled words are the most common bug issue that is at the result of fast typing to get the project done I considerable profession time. Slow down a little and get it done right the first time.

I had to research and copy and this code below because I couldn't remember it. I still need some info on what it means.

```js
// Regular expression for validating email format

const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
```

### Continued development

- I Leverage my skill in JavaScript more and more.
- I am getting really awesome at CSS.
